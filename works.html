          <p>The Olympiad Match Program aims to connect low-income students aspiring to pursue bachelor's degrees in the United States with suitable universities. A key requirement for participation is involvement in at least one international Olympiad during high school, supported by an official statement confirming participation.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This program streamlines the application process akin to the Common App, condensing multiple applications into a single, comprehensive form. Upon selection as a finalist, we liaise with your counselor to obtain your academic report and official transcripts.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In the final stage, we endeavor to match you with a university that aligns with your personality and aspirations. Subsequently, the university may request additional requirements to secure your final acceptance.</p>
